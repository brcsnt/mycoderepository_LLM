Revised and Improved Prompt (in English)

Below is a prompt designed to analyze a company’s campaign description and extract specific, searchable information (tags/key details) that users might query to locate this campaign. The goal is to provide these details in a structured format so that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model can accurately retrieve the campaign during question answering.

Task

Review a campaign’s description and generate a structured list of concise tags (keywords) capturing critical campaign details. Focus on specific, searchable information that would help a RAG model match user queries to this campaign.

Steps to Follow and Format
	1.	Identify and extract information from the campaign text under the following categories. If a category does not appear in the campaign text, omit that category from your JSON output (i.e., do not include empty arrays):
	•	campaign_objective: The campaign’s primary goal (e.g., "brand_awareness", "product_launch", "seasonal_sale").
	•	target_audience: Demographics or interests (e.g., "young_adults", "gamers", "eco_conscious_consumers").
	•	products_services: Items or services being promoted (e.g., "smartphones", "subscription_plans").
	•	key_offers: Discounts, promotions, or incentives (e.g., "20_percent_off", "free_shipping").
	•	timeframe: The duration or time window of the campaign (e.g., "q4_2023", "black_friday").
	•	channels: Marketing or communication channels (e.g., "social_media", "email_newsletters").
	•	geographic_scope: Geographic location(s) targeted (e.g., "global", "united_states").
	•	unique_themes: Specific slogans, hashtags, or unique messages (e.g., "sustainability", "limited_edition", "#adventureawaits" → "adventureawaits").
	2.	Output Format:
	•	Provide your answer as a JSON object.
	•	For each category you include, use lowercase letters and underscores (_) instead of spaces.
	•	Keep the tags concise and avoid long phrases.
	•	Do not add categories with no relevant data.
	3.	Additional Guidelines:
	•	If there are numeric values and symbols (e.g., “15% off”), convert them to a tag-friendly format (e.g., "15_percent_off").
	•	If multiple tags belong to the same category, list each as a separate array item (e.g., "target_audience": ["outdoor_enthusiasts", "age_18_35"]).
	•	Hashtags should either have the # removed or retained as all-lowercase (e.g., #AdventureAwaits → "adventureawaits").
	•	Keep each piece of information distinct (e.g., “hiking gear” and “camping equipment” should be two separate tags under "products_services").

Example Input

"Our Summer 2023 campaign, #AdventureAwaits, targets outdoor enthusiasts aged 18-35 with 15% off hiking gear and camping equipment. Promoted via Instagram and TikTok in the US and Canada."

Example Output

{
  "campaign_objective": ["seasonal_sale"],
  "target_audience": ["outdoor_enthusiasts", "age_18_35"],
  "products_services": ["hiking_gear", "camping_equipment"],
  "key_offers": ["15_percent_off"],
  "timeframe": ["summer_2023"],
  "channels": ["instagram", "tiktok"],
  "geographic_scope": ["us", "canada"],
  "unique_themes": ["adventureawaits"]
}

Campaign Text (Input)

{Insert campaign text here}

Improvements Made and Why
	1.	Clarity on Omitted Categories
Specified that if a category has no relevant data, it should not appear in the JSON output at all. This prevents the generation of empty arrays or unnecessary fields.
	2.	Tag Conversion Details
Added explicit instructions on how to convert numeric values and symbols (e.g., “%” → “percent”) to maintain a consistent, query-friendly format.
	3.	Hashtag Handling
Clarified how to handle hashtags (removing the symbol, converting to lowercase) to avoid inconsistencies in the final output.
	4.	Separate Tags for Multiple Entries
Emphasized listing different pieces of information (e.g., multiple products or locations) as separate tags within the same category array.
	5.	“Additional Guidelines” Section
Consolidated all special instructions (numeric conversions, handling multiple entries, hashtags, etc.) for quick reference, making the prompt more user-friendly and comprehensive.
