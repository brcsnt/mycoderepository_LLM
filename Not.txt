XYZ Bot Plus is a chatbot system that allows users to quickly and accurately access campaign information. Instead of searching manually, users can simply ask a question through the chatbot interface and get campaign details instantly.

First, the user types a question into the chatbot. The question is sent to the campaign bot, which searches the Elasticsearch database for the relevant campaign code and description. Then, the bot combines the user’s question with the campaign details and sends it to the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the most accurate response. The LLM analyzes the question and creates a suitable answer. Finally, the chatbot delivers the response to the user, providing quick access to the necessary information without the need for manual searching.

To ensure that the information is always up to date, campaign data is synchronized from the SQL database to Elasticsearch every hour. This way, users can always access the most accurate and updated campaign details.







Here’s the English version in a conversational tone with numbers written out:

XYZ Bot Plus is a chatbot application powered by new technologies that gathers all campaign information and details from our bank into a single platform.

When we open the application, we’re welcomed by a simple screen.

Instead of manually searching for campaign details, users can just ask XYZ Bot Plus a question and get the information they need instantly.

Let’s start by asking about a specific campaign using its code.

For example, we can ask, “What is the campaign twelve three four?” The bot will then provide a brief summary of the campaign.

To prevent users from asking questions that include confidential customer or bank information, we’ve added a control layer. A reminder about this is also shown in the info section.

Since the bot keeps a history of our conversation, we can continue asking follow-up questions without repeating the campaign code.

Now, let’s ask, “What are the valid dates for this campaign?” The bot will respond with the campaign’s start and end dates.

Next, let’s switch to a different campaign.

We can ask, “What is the maximum reward for the campaign twelve three four?” The bot will then provide details on the maximum reward users can earn if they meet the conditions.

Now, let’s ask something a bit more complex.

For example, “If a customer spends one thousand Turkish lira on January tenth, how much reward will they earn?” The bot will calculate and provide the reward amount.

Right now, XYZ Bot Plus finds answers by searching based on campaign codes.

We’re also working on enabling searches using campaign content.

This should work well for your demo in English! Let me know if you need any refinements.
